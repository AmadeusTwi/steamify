# Steamify

This project is a showcase of Steam redesign, inspired by [Juxtopposed](https://www.youtube.com/@juxtopposed)'s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDY2p1CTkPo).

> This app is a work in progress. I'm building this in public. You can follow the progress on my Twitter/X - [@AmadeusTwi](https://twitter.com/AmadeusTwi).

## About this project

Project's objective is to recreate the shown redesign as close as possible, using Next.js 14's features,  Tailwind CSS and other great tools out there.

Initial scaffold was created using [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/) and is subject to change depending on the project's needs - features may be added and even deleted.

## Current features

- Next.js App Router
- Authentication using **NextAuth.js** (might consider **Clerk**)
- ORM using **Drizzle**
- Database on **PlanetScale**
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS**
- Validations using **Zod**
- Written in **TypeScript**

P.S. Hey, I know I might not need all of these tools, stuff **will** change, and I'm open to suggestions.

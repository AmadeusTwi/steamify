> Hey! It's me, AmadeusTwi, it's been a while since I touched on this project and my development halted for personal reasons. But soon enough, I will resume the development and I'm very sorry that I was not able to deliver on speed of the development. I feel like I let Juxtopposed's idea go to waste and the stars I got from this repo are undeserved, which is not what I want at all.

## About this project

Project's objective is to recreate the shown redesign as close as possible, using Next.js 14's features,  Tailwind CSS and other great tools out there.

Initial scaffold was created using [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/) and is subject to change depending on the project's needs - features may be added and even deleted.

## Current features

- Next.js App Router
- Authentication using **NextAuth.js** (might consider **Clerk**)
- ORM using **Drizzle**
- Database on **PlanetScale**
- Styled using **Tailwind CSS**
- Validations using **Zod**
- Written in **TypeScript**

P.S. Hey, I know I might not need all of these tools, stuff **will** change, and I'm open to suggestions.
